# FutureKit for Swift
A Swift based Future/Promises Library for IOS and OS X.   


FutureKit is a iOS implementation of Futures and Promises, but modified specifically for iOS/OSX programmers.

FutureKit sues Swift generic classes, to allow you to easily deal with asynchronous/multi-threaded issues when coding for iOS or OSX.

FutureKit is ALMOST ready to be used.  This is the "eval" version.  Please look around and tell us what you think.  A lot of work went into it so far, but we are ready to start showing it off.  We are STILL making changes, (changes in nomenclature, logic, etc.).  And trying to get all the code documented (using XCode 6.3 built in markdown).  This is a really good version, and feel free to play around.  But there is a good chance we are make some source-code-breaking changes in the next few weeks.  So don't say I didn't warn you.  This file will officially tell you when we think we have hit "1.0".   

The goal is to have a working version out before the end of May, with the official.  All of the primary Swift code is written.  But we are still tweaking things and trying to get to tests written that cover all the critical versions.

- is 100% Swift.  It ONLY currently supports Swift 1.2 and XCode 6.3.  No Swift 1.1 support.  I have currently only been testing using iOS 8.0.  The plan will be to fix compatibility issues with iOS 7.0.  But I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if things break with this build.

- is type safe.  It uses Swift Generics classes that can automatically infer the type you wish to return from asynchronous logic.  And supports all Swift types (Both 'Any' types, and 'AnyObject/NSObject' types!)

- uses simple to understand methods (onComplete/onSuccess/onFail etc) that let's you simplify complex asynchronous operations into clear and simple to understand logic.

- is highly composable, since any existing Future can be used to generate a new Future.  And Errors and Cancelations can be automatically passed through, simplifying error handling logic.  

- works well editing code within XCode 6.3 auto-completion.  The combination of type-inference and code-completion makes FutureKit coding fast and easy.

- simplifies the use of Apple GCD by using Executors - a simple Swift enumeration that attracts the most common iOS/OSX Dispatch Queues (Main,Default,Background, etc).  Allowing you to guarantee that logic will always be executed in the context you want.  (You never have to worry about having to call the correct dispatch_async() function again).  
- is highly tunable, allowing you to configure how the primary Executors (Immediate vs Async) execute, and what sort Thread Synchronization FutureKit will use (Barriers - Locks, etc).  Allowing you to tune FutureKit's logic to match what you need.  



# Documentation

FutureKit documentation is being written as XCode Playgrounds.  The best way to start is to open the FutureKit.workspace and then opening the Playground inside.  (If you open the Playgrounds outside of the workspace, then FutureKit module may not import correctly).
The XCode Playgrounds probably require XCode 6.3 (in order to see the Markup correctly)

If you are impatient, or not near your copy of XCode, you can try to read the first intro "raw" playground here:
https://github.com/FutureKit/FutureKit/blob/master/FutureKit-Future.playground/Contents.swift

There is also docs directory, that is generated using jazzy. https://github.com/realm/jazzy.  The plan is to get as close to 100% as possible (We are at 25%!).  So currently there is a lot of missing documentation.

# Help out!  

I would love it to get feedback!  Tell me what you think is wrong.  You can follow @swiftfuturekit to get announcements (when we make them).
